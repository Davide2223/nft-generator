=====================================

MY PERSONAL PROJECT 99% INTELIGGENT AND 1% HUMAN CONTROL

Why this project?

NFT Generator is a project that was made to me by a friend of mine, as he wanted it, so I decided to do it;
Before this smart version there was another one that in order to use it you had to know how to use python

What is an nft?
----------------

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded.
Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio.
Because each token is uniquely identifiable, NFTs differ from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

What is an nft generator?
----------------

A nft generator is a program that allows you to match all the input images divided into delay to create as many nft as possible.
Which is very useful for those who want to sell NFT or even packages of NFT given the immense amount of NFT that can be generated.

How a nft generator works?
----------------

There is no general functioning for an nft generator, I have developed my own algorithm which is based on the final binary tree grouping if you can call it that.
The rest is present in the code which is commented step by step
